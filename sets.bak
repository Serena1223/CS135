;; Part A
;; (union s1 s2) produces a list without duplicates of the union of set 1 and set 2
;; Examples:
(check-expect (union (list 1 3 4 1) (list 1 5)) (list 1 3 4 5))
(check-expect (union (list 1 3 4 1) (list 1 3)) (list 1 3 4))

;; union: (setof Nat) (setof Nat) -> (setof Nat)

;; Part B
;; (intersection s1 s2) produces the overlaps between set 1 and 2
;; Examples:
(check-expect (union (list 1 3 4 1) (list 1 5)) (list 1))
(check-expect (union (list 1 3 4 1) (list 1 3)) (list 1 3))

;; intersection: (setof Nat) (setof Nat) -> (setof Nat)
