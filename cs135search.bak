(a) Create a function both which consumes two DLs and produces a doc-list (DL) that occur
in both DLs. For example,
(both (list "b.txt") (list "b.txt" "c.txt")) should produce (list "b.txt").
;;

(b) Create a function exclude which consumes two DLs and produces a doc-list (DL) that
occur in the first DL but not the second one. For example,
(exclude (list "b.txt" "c.txt") (list "b.txt")) should produce (list "c.txt").

(c) Create a function (keys-retrieve doc an-il) which consumes a Str and an IL and
produces a (listof Str) with lexicographic ordering. The values in the produced list
are the keys from an-il whose doc-lists contain doc. If doc is not contained in the
doc-list associated with any keys in an-il, then keys-retrieve returns empty.
For example, if we passed "a.txt" and the IL shown at the top of this page to keys-retrieve,
it would return (list "cat" "sleeps" "the").
